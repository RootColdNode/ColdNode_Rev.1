# ColdNode_Rev.1
Abstract

ColdNode Rev. 1 is a wireless sensor node based on the wireless MCU CC430. The firmware is forked from the panStamp core and is compatible with the Arduino 1.5 or later.
This revision incorproates the Wake-Up receiver (WuRx) technology to achieve pure on-demand communication whilst consuming less than 10 ÂµA.
The WuRx features a sensitivty of -60 dBm and a data rate of 4 kbps (Manchester). The sensore node is equiped with temperature, humidity and accelerometer sensors.
The low-power module and its RF availabilty makes it suitable for very low traffic wireless sensor networks.
