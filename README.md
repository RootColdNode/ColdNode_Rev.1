# ColdNode_Rev.1
Abstract

ColdNode Rev. 1 is a wireless sensor nodes based on the wireless MCU CC430. The firmware is mainly based on panStamp core, compatible with latest version of Arduino.
This revision incorproates the Wake-Up receiver (WuRx) technology to achieve pure on-demand communication whilst conuming less than 10 ÂµA.
The WuRx features a sensitivty of -60 dBm and a datarate of 4 kbps (Manchester). The sensore node is equiped with temperature, humidity and accelerometer sensors.
The low-power module and it RF availabilty makes it suitable for very low traffic wireless sensor networks.
